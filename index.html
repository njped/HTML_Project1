        I love being able to spend time with my friends and family.
        The things I like to do with them are playing boardgames, watching movies,
        making lego sets and many other things too.

        Other things I like doing is coding. Right now I'm taking a coding class and it is really fun to make incredible
        things like web pages. You start to have a new found respect to all those that go into computer programming. How
        they under each individual command will allow them to make amazing websites.

    <h3>How to Code</h3>
    <p>
        This is just a simple line of code developer will use
    <pre>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!!!&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
    This allows them to make a header at the top of the webpage you see headers everytime you go to a website!
